# as-libs-buildtools

This is an internal library with common code used in the
development of my other projects like compilers and transpilers.
On it's own it's not very useful. Also it is in a continuously
changing phase. Download it only if you need to compile my other
projects like [Contijac](https://github.com/ansorre/As-Libs-Core) for example.
